//! # rkyv
//!
//! rkyv (*archive*) is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust.
//!
//! It's similar to other zero-copy deserialization frameworks such as
//! [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org) and
//! [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers). However, while the
//! former have external schemas and heavily restricted data types, rkyv allows
//! all serialized types to be defined in code and can serialize a wide variety
//! of types that the others cannot. Additionally, rkyv is designed to have
//! little to no overhead, and in most cases will perform exactly the same as
//! native types.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Like [serde](https://serde.rs), rkyv uses Rust's powerful trait system to
//! serialize data without the need for reflection. Despite having a wide array
//! of features, you also only pay for what you use. If your data checks out,
//! the serialization process can be as simple as a `memcpy`! Like serde, this
//! allows rkyv to perform at speeds similar to handwritten serializers.
//!
//! Unlike serde, rkyv produces data that is guaranteed deserialization free. If
//! you wrote your data to disk, you can just `mmap` your file into memory, cast
//! a pointer, and your data is ready to use. This makes it ideal for
//! high-performance and IO-bound applications.
//!
//! Limited data mutation is supported through `Pin` APIs, and archived values can
//! be truly deserialized with [`Deserialize`] if full mutation capabilities are
//! needed.
//!
//! ## Type support
//!
//! rkyv has a hashmap implementation that is built for zero-copy
//! deserialization, so you can serialize your hashmaps with abandon. The
//! implementation performs perfect hashing with the compress, hash and displace
//! algorithm to use as little memory as possible while still performing fast
//! lookups.
//!
//! rkyv also has support for contextual serialization, deserialization, and
//! validation. It can properly serialize and deserialize shared pointers like
//! `Rc` and `Arc`, and can be extended to support custom contextual types.
//!
//! One of the most impactful features made possible by rkyv is the ability to
//! serialize trait objects and use them *as trait objects* without
//! deserialization. See the `archive_dyn` crate for more details.
//!
//! ## Tradeoffs
//!
//! rkyv is designed primarily for loading bulk game data as efficiently as
//! possible. While rkyv is a great format for final data, it lacks a full
//! schema system and isn't well equipped for data migration. Using a
//! serialization library like serde can help fill these gaps, and you can use
//! serde with the same types as rkyv conflict-free.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `const_generics`: Improves the trait implementations for arrays with
//!   support for all lengths
//! - `size_64`: Archives `*size` as `*64` instead of `*32`. This is for large
//!   archive support
//! - `std`: Enables standard library support (enabled by default)
//! - `strict`: Guarantees that types will have the same representations across
//!   platforms and compilations. This is already the case in practice, but this
//!   feature provides a guarantee. It additionally provides C type
//!   compatibility.
//! - `validation`: Enables validation support through `bytecheck`
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! See [`Archive`] for examples of how to use rkyv.
